1. The most proud project
It is a project that tries to improve the speech recognition quality. First please let me briefly describe the scenario and background a littl bit. Nowadays speech recognition accuracy is already very high, but it often fails on some special name queries, especially the tail business names. Name query is something like Safeway, Costco, and it can also be a local restaurant or other businesses. When the name query is popular, speech recognition can do it very well. However, if the name is not very popular, speech recognition performance is not very promising, and it is very common for the users to query some local businesses. For example, there is a restaurant near my office, city center bellevue, and its name is nibbala thai restaurant. Because nibbala is not very common in our training data, speech recognition often recognize it to nearby thai restaurant.
I proposed to leverage knowledge graph and search query click logs to resolve this problem. Knowledge graph contains a lot of entities and their metadata, also the relationships between them. When the query is a local business, it is more likely to be a business in the area of the user's location, so I invented a geographical language model by using knowledge graph. Different city has different language model, and the language model is adaptive based on the user's location. Meanwhile, I also rescored the utterance probability based on the context within the conversation. If the first utterance is "show me the thai restaurants near me", the utterance that contains restaurant entity will be boosted among the top N best candidates. The experiment shows a significant improvement on local query set.
I wrote a paper about it and published it in InterSpeech2017 conference, which is a top conference in speech recognitino field. The company also filed a patent for me. During the conference, the head of the cortana speech recognition team showed a very strong interest on it, and the guys from Google and Apple also asked a lot of questions. When I returned from the conference, cortana team scheduled several meetings to discuss more details about it, and I helped them to implement my idea in cortana as an consultant.

2. How do you handle the conflict between you and your manager
First I want to say it is very rear for me to have conflict with my manager. I trust my manager, because 1) good relationship with my manager is very important, and it can make my life easier if I can get my manager's support. 2) they are already qualified to be a manager, and that means they are strong and above average. 3) They have more opportunities to contact the leadership, so propabably they know much more information than me. However, sometimes I may still have the conflict with my manager regarding some concret project. I remember one time we want to improve our search relevance, and my manager told us we need to improve our location understanding. That is fair, because our location understanding part does have issues. For example, we can't understand the street, or pois. However, we actually have other issues that is more severe than location understanding, which is simple category queries, like restaurant near me, hotel in seattle. We may return hotel agents for hotel queries, since we may not understand the query is asking hotel, and we may not understand an entity is a hotel. I think these queries has higher query share and users expect us to do a perfect job. If we can't handle the simple query well, how can we handle the complicated queries with complicated location, and how can the user trust us? I prepared some data, like the query share, metrics of each kind of query, which can show how bad we are doing for a parcitular kind of queries, and I told my manager my thoughts, and showed him my data, then he was convinced we need to spend more resoures on the simple category queries. At last, we improved our query understand and entity understand for the simple category query, and we reduced the gap between G and us by more than 50 percent.
