1. The most proud project
It is a project that tries to improve the speech recognition quality. First please let me briefly describe the scenario and background a littl bit. Nowadays speech recognition accuracy is already very high, but it often fails on some special name queries, especially the tail business names. Name query is something like Safeway, Costco, and it can also be a local restaurant or other businesses. When the name query is popular or chains, speech recognition can do it very well. However, if the name is not a chain, or not very popular, speech recognition performance is not very promising, and it is very common for the users to query some local businesses. For example, there is a restaurant near my office, city center bellevue, and its name is nibbala thai restaurant. Because nibbala is not very common in our training data, speech recognition often recognize it to nearby thai restaurant.
